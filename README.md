## Introduction

BBMA Dancer is an EA that uses the Bollinger Bands Moving Average (BBMA) indicator to generate trading signals. It opens buy or sell positions based on the direction of the BBMA indicator. The EA also includes features like stop loss and take profit levels for risk management.

## Features

- Uses the BBMA indicator to generate trading signals
- Supports custom input parameters for fast and slow periods, lot size, stop loss, and take profit
- Includes risk management features for modifying or closing positions based on profit or loss levels

## Installation

To use BBMA Dancer, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `mql5` folder to your MetaTrader 4 terminal's `MQL5` folder.
2. Restart MetaTrader 4.
3. Open the MetaEditor and compile the `mt4.mq5` file.
4. Attach the compiled EA to a chart and configure the input parameters.

## Parameters

BBMA Dancer supports the following input parameters:

- `fastPeriod` - Fast period for the BBMA indicator.
- `slowPeriod` - Slow period for the BBMA indicator.
- `lotSize` - Initial lot size to trade.
- `stopLoss` - Stop loss value in pips.
- `takeProfit` - Take profit value in pips.

## Indicator

The BBMA indicator is a custom indicator used by BBMA Dancer. It calculates the difference between two moving averages (fast and slow) and stores the values in the `bbmaBuffer` array.

## Expert Advisor

The Expert Advisor (EA) part of BBMA Dancer is responsible for executing trades based on the signals generated by the BBMA indicator. It uses the `CTrade` class to open, modify, or close positions.

The EA checks if there is an open position for the current symbol. If there is an open position, it checks the current profit, stop loss, and take profit levels. It modifies or closes the position based on these levels.

If there is no open position, the EA checks the value of the BBMA buffer. If the value is positive, it opens a buy position. If the value is negative, it opens a sell position. It also sets the stop loss and take profit levels for the new position.
